# Home_Sales

# Summary

This project utilizes SparkSQL to analyze home sales data, including calculating average prices based on various criteria and optimizing query performance. Tasks involve creating temporary views, partitioning data, caching tables, and comparing query runtimes. The results are saved in a Jupyter Notebook and uploaded to a GitHub repository named "Home_Sales."
The Starter_Code folder contains the solution code for Google CoLab. 

# Notes
Certain questions were relocated to a markdown cell within the solution file. 
This adjustment was made to enhance clarity for anyone reviewing the code, particularly 
enabling easier visibility of the longer queries separated from the questions.
